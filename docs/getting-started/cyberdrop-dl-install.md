# Cyberdrop-DL Install

## Using Start Scripts (From Release Page)

This is the simplest method to get the program up and running. Pre-configured start files are provided that will automatically install python, install cyberdrop-dl, update, and launch the program for you.

{% hint style="info" %}
The start scripts only work on 64bits operating systems. If you are running a 32bit OS, you need to install directly from pypi and may need to compile some dependencies
{% endhint %}

You can download them here: [https://github.com/Cyberdrop-DL/cyberdrop-dl/releases/latest](https://github.com/Cyberdrop-DL/cyberdrop-dl/releases/latest)

You only need to download the `Cyberdrop-DL_<version>.zip` file, you don't need to worry about the other files.

Extract the contents of the zip file to any location where you'd like the program to run and store downloaded files. The extracted files will include an install files for Windows, macOS, and Linux

Run the `install` file to install/update `cyberdrop-dl`, then use the `run` file to run it

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using Windows, **DO NOT** run the script as admin
{% endhint %}

## Manual Install

### 1. Using `uv`

The recommended way to install Cyberdrop-DL is using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

{% tabs %}

{% tab title="macOS / Linux" %}

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Once you have `uv`, you can install Cyberdrop-DL using:

```shell
uv tool install cyberdrop-dl-patched
```

### 2. Manual Python Install

If you do not want to or can't use `uv`, you will need to install a compatible python version manually.

If you don't have python, you can find and download it from their official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Cyberdrop-DL requires python >=3.12
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are using a version of Cyberdrop-DL from the previous repository (`cyberdrop-dl` instead of `cyberdrop-dl-patched`), you **MUST** uninstall it before installing the patched version.

```shell
pip uninstall cyberdrop-dl
```

{% endhint %}

Once you have python, you can install Cyberdrop-DL directly from pypi using `pipx` or `pip`. In a command prompt/terminal window:

{% tabs %}

{% tab title="pipx" %}

- Install `pipx` (if you don't have it already)

```shell
pip install pipx
```

- Install cdl

```shell
pipx install cyberdrop-dl-patched
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="pip" %}
{% hint style="warning" %}
Using bare `pip` to install `cyberdrop-dl-patched` is discouraged as it may lead to dependency conflicts with global installs and an inconsistent environment. Consider using `uv` or `pipx`
{% endhint %}

```shell
pip install cyberdrop-dl-patched
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
